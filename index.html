				<h1>What is React JS</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>React is a JavaScript library </br>that is used to build user interface.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>React was originally intended for the web, for building websites, but later the React Native
							platform
							appeared, which was already intended for mobile devices.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>React presents the perfect tool for building scalable web applications.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Virtual DOM</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>The entire structure of a web page can be represented using the DOM (Document Object Model) - an
							organization of html elements that we can manipulate, modify, delete or add new ones.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>JavaScript is used to interact with the DOM.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The virtual DOM represents a lightweight copy of the regular DOM. And a distinctive feature of
							React is
							that this library works with the virtual DOM, and not the usual one.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>Virtual DOM</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>If an application needs to know information about the state of elements, then the virtual DOM is
							accessed.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>If elements of a web page need to be changed, the changes are first made to the virtual DOM. Then
							the new
							state of the virtual DOM is compared with the current state. And if these states are different,
							then
							React finds the minimum amount of manipulation that is necessary before updating the real DOM to a
							new
							state and performs them.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>Other features of React</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>we can create individual components and then easily transfer them from project to project.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>we use JSX</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>JSX represents a combination of JavaScript and XML code and provides a simple and intuitive way
							to define the visual interface code.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>also to compile the code, we need the Babel compiler, which allows us to work with the code
							according to
							the standard
							ES6 (ES2015).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Project template engines are available.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>Other features of React</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>The concept of View from MVC is used.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>React allows you to create interfaces. In the well-known pattern Model-View-Controller React is
							closest
							to the user. It is responsible for presenting data, receiving and processing user input. Where and
							in
							what form you store data, how you communicate with the storage, is your business. React is just a
							View of
							your application.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>Other features of React</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>React is built on the reactive programming paradigm. This declarative approach suggests describing
							data as a set of statements or formulas. Changing one of the parameters leads to an automatic
							recalculation of all dependencies</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1> Beginning of work</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>The ReactDOM.render () method is used to render an element on a web page, which takes two
							parameters.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The first parameter represents the component that we want to display on the web page. In this case,
							this
							is a normal title.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>This method is passed the element to add to the web page. The second parameter is the element of
							the web
							page in which the component from the first parameter will be rendered. In this case, this is the
						<div id="app"> element.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>This is exactly the element where the title will be placed.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

				<h1> Setup</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>There are several ways to use React.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The officially recommended way is from npm or Facebook CDN, but additionally you can clone from git
							and
							create your own builds.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Alternatively, you can use the starter kit or save time with the Yeoman Application Framework
							Generator.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>Using CDN for Facebook</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>For quick access, simply link the React and React Dom libraries from the fb.me CDN as follows:</p>
			<pre>
<code>
	<script src="https://fb.me/react-0.14.0.js"> </script>
	<script src="https://fb.me/react-dom-0.14.0.js"> </script>
</code>
</pre>

					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>Installing from NPM</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>The React manual also recommends using the react and react-dom npm packages. To install them on
							your
							system, run the following command on the bash command line in your project directory, or first
							create a
							new directory and cd into it.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>$ npm install --save react react-dom
							$ browserify -t babelify main.js -o bundle.js

							You should now be able to see the React installation inside the node_modules directory.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1> What is JSX?</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>JSX is an XML / HTML syntax that is used to render HTML from JavaScript code. React
							converts JSX to native JavaScript for the browser and with the provided tools you can
							convert HTML code of existing sites to JSX</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1> What is JSX?</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>JSX makes it easier to write code because it is very similar to writing familiar HTML, but only
							from
							within JavaScript. When combined with Node, this provides a very consistent workflow.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
